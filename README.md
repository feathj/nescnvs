NES Demo for INST hackweek
=============================
I really wanted to learn the NES architecture and 6502 assembly for my hackweek
project, so this is my first NES "game" (currently just renders a canvas logo).


Build / Run steps
=================
* Compiled with NESASM
* Install `nesasm` and `fceux` (or other emulator)

`nesasm nescnvs.asm`
`fceux nescnvs.nes`

* Sprites were built using YY-CHR, running on WINE since I am on OSX


Resources

Pretty much the bible of NES homebrew:
